# Service Design
## IN COLLABORATION WITH MALMÖ CIVIC LAB & FÖRSKOLEFÖRVALTNINGEN
### This project was conducted in collaboration with Malmö Civic Lab in order to provide them with a way to improve Förskoleförvaltningens Onboarding process. The project allows the process of introducing new employees to become more efficient and less cumbersome for everyone involved. We worked in order to provide the right information and equipment for the newly employed at the right time. And finally we wanted to create an easier and faster way, for the newly employed to becoming part of the workplace based team and allow them to feel equal to their colleagues. Due to confidential information, I will not be able to provide all details regarding the project. However, I am able to provide sketches, userjourneys, and prototypes, etc.
